### Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
ALS is a kind of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms. It can be used to build a recommendation engine :
Deciding that two users may both like the same restaurants because they review many other same restaurants.


### Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
LSA is a technique in natural language processing that seeks to better understand a corpus of documents and the relationships between the words in those documents.
It attempts to distill the corpus into a set of relevant concepts.
Each concept consists of three attributes: a level of affinity for each document in the corpus, a level of affinity for each term in the corpus, and an importance score reflecting how useful the concept is in describing variance in the data set.
By selecting only the most important concepts, LSA can throw away some irrelevant noise and merge co-occurring strands to come up with a simpler representation of the data.
